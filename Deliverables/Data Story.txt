Ask the following questions and look for the answers using code and plots:
Can you count something interesting?
Can you find trends (e.g. high, low, increasing, decreasing, anomalies)?
Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?
Can you compare two related quantities?
Can you make a scatterplot?
Can you make a time-series plot?
Looking at the plots, what are some insights you can make? Do you see any correlations? Is there a hypothesis you’d like to investigate further? What other questions do the insights lead you to ask?
Now that you’ve asked questions, hopefully you’ve found some interesting insights. Is there a narrative or a way of presenting the insights using text and plots that tells a compelling story? What are some other trends/relationships you think will make the story more complete?
